### Token, websocket connection and groups subscriptions 

The token, websocket and subscriptions handling is summarized in the following graphs:

![redux state machine graph](./redux-auth.svg 'Redux token authentication state machine graph')

##### Token handling

- Token starts with status EMPTY
- When the application initiates, it tries to read the token from the local storage (status is READ_FROM_LOCAL_STORAGE)
- If there is a token it is validated (status REQUESTED)
- If there is no token it remains in EMPTY
- Once the user logs in, the status is REQUESTED
- Once the response is ok (200), the status changes to RECEIVED and the websockets connection is opened
- If the response fails, it goes to either ERROR, REJECTED or EXPIRED, depending on response codes. In any case the websocket connection is closed
- When a user logs out, then the status is REMOVE_REQUESTED
- When the response arrives and it was deleted (204) the status is REMOVED_REMOTELY, otherwise REMOVE_ERROR

##### Token swap

- Token swap starts with (swap) status SWAP_RECEIVED
- Once the user opens the swap login panel, the swap status changes to SWAP_REQUIRED
- If the user cancels the swap login panel, the swap status changes back to SWAP_RECEIVED
- Once the user attempts a user swap, the swap status is SWAP_REQUESTED
- Once the response is ok (200), the status changes to SWAP_RECEIVED and the websockets connection is closed and then reopened
- If the response fails, it goes to either SWAP_ERROR or SWAP_REJECTED, depending on response codes. The websocket connection is not closed since the previous token is still in use

##### Websocket connection handling

- Connection status starts as CLOSED
- When token is received/validated we dispatch an `openWebsocketConnection` action
- When connection is opened, then the connection status is OPENING, and when ready it is OPEN
- On most errors or close, the connection status is RETRYING
- When status is RETRYING an interval function runs every 3 seconds, attempting to reconnect
- When connection is gracefully closed, then the status is CLOSED

##### Subscriptions are decoupled from connection

- Each subscription has a status: PENDING, REQUESTING, SUBSCRIBED or UNSUBSCRIBING
- Components add subscriptions dispatching `addGroupSubnscription` action (status PENDING)
- If connection is opened, then the subscriptions are requested automatically (status REQUESTING)
- Also when the connection is opened, then all PENDING subscriptions are requested
- When confirmation is received, then they change to status SUBSCRIBED
- When unsubscribing, then they change to UNSUBSCRIBING
- When confirmation of unsubscription arrive, then the subscription changes to PENDING
- When connection is closed, then all subscriptions are PENDING. This way, when we open the connection again, we will be able to re-subscribe
- Also, subscription are reset (changed to PENDING and re-requested) every 5 minutes
