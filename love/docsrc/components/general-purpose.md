General Purpose components are basic building blocks, such as buttons, labels and charts, that can be used to build any kind of user interfaces, independently of their purpose.

You can distinguish Container components from Presentational components by looking at the `Container` suffix. For example, the `Camera` Presentational component has its respective Container component called `CameraContainer`. Otherwise you can safely assume they are `Presentational` components.
